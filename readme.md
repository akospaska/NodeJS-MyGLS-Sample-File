### Hello Guys! 👋

### Hello NodeJS community! 👋

### MyGLS NodeJS Rest API sample file!!

You can find the Mygls API documentation and the sample files on this site: https://api.mygls.hu/

Unfortunatelly the official sample files only exist in the following Coding languages: C# ,Java ,PHP

That's why i have created this sample code in NodeJS. 🎉🎉

You can reach the Kotlin based Mygls Api sample file through here: https://github.com/akospaska/Mygls-Kotlin-Sample-File-REST-API

## The following methods are included:

- PrintLabels
- PrepareLabels
- GetPrintedLabels
- DeleteLAbels
- GetParcelStatuses

<br />

## Authentication's details

The GetAuthenticationDetails class contains all of the data what are needed for the authentication.
If you own your own mygls account, than feel free to modify the GetAuthenticationDetails class's return values.

## Label PDF creation

In this sample code the Label in PDF format will be created by the PrintLabels method.
The main root of the Labels are in the src/createdLabels folder.
